Experienced Translator and Copywriter / Arabic-English
Born as a native Arabic speaker and born again as a native English speaker! I have been working as an Arabic/English translator for quite some time now.

### I have plenty of experience doing translations in either direction and can take on any job you might have! trust me I can :)

Also, I have a quick turnaround as I have a lot of available time to do your job in a correct and professional manner since I try to earn the title of "BEST ARABIC TRANSLATOR IN JORDAN"!

### My services include:

All sorts of translations (general/business/medical/technical/legal etc.) from my languages (Arabic and English)
Proofreading, Editing & Language Analysis in Arabic and English language (Spelling, Grammar, Style, Sentiment, Usage, Meaning, etc.)
Basic digital services like data processing, text processing or web research.
Why clients hire me:

### I work quickly and accurately and give them the attention they deserve!
Punctual delivery is guaranteed.
I am interested in specifics and I ask the right questions
I communicate task-related issues clearly and effectively before, during and after the job
I am highly reliable and constantly available, with a response time of maximum 12, but mostly less than 3 hours (no matter which time zone)
I am flexible and adaptive to the needs of the client and the particular requirements of the job
I deliver affordably, but highest-quality work.
